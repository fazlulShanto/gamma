// The first-run tour. Data only: anchors from guide/anchors.js, events from
// guide/events.js. A step with no anchor is a centred card. A step with `do`
// is a demo: the guide performs the actions itself (click / type / press /
// waitFor / wait), then moves on — or, with `advanceOn`, hands over to the
// user, whose own try ticks the step (Next moves on without it). The copy is
// a short title, and a body only for what the demo cannot show; `bodyTouch`
// words it for touch. `skippable: false` keeps "Skip this demo" off a demo
// the rest of the tour depends on. `{demoUrl}` in typed text comes from
// `vars` (overridable through the localStorage key gamma-guide-vars). Start
// it from the account menu's Tours > Your first paper. It is also offered,
// as its welcome deck, on the library of a demo server once the guest lands
// and on a library with nothing in it yet but the seeded Welcome page and Sketchbook: the
// trigger's own `requires` / `anyOf` gate only that offer, so the tour stays
// startable everywhere.
//
// `welcome: true`: the first (`intro`) step is the welcome deck, the tour's
// arrival offer (GuideOverlay's WelcomeDeck): what Gamma does, one slide at a
// time, each a looping drawing (`media`, guide/media.js) beside its topic,
// title and line. The first slide carries this tour. A slide whose feature
// is set up in Settings or another app names its setup guide (`setup`) and
// the words of its way in (`go`). The last slide holds the deck's way in
// (`next`), which opens the seeded Welcome page, and its footnote.
// A run never shows the intro: started from the deck, the Tours menu or the
// library's "Take the 2-minute tour", the tour opens on its first step.
