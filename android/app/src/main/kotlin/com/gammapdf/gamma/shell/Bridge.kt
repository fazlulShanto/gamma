// The one place that knows the protocol between the web app and the shell,
// ported from ipad/GammaIPad/Shell/Bridge.swift. The web half is
// frontend/src/shared/lib/host.js, and assets/shell/host.js carries both
// directions over the WebView's message port (shell/HostBridge.kt); both are
// described in docs/dev/ipad.md "The host contract". The vocabulary is kept
// small on purpose: a web feature reaches the app without touching it, and a
// new message is added here and in host.js together, with a flag in HostInfo
// saying what the web may rely on (`version` only names the build).
