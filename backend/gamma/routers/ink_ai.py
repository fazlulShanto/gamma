"""The handwriting selection's AI actions (docs/dev/handwriting_ai.md):
/ai/ink/shapes behind Redraw as shapes and /ai/ink/text behind Convert to
text. Each takes the selected strokes as the client's draft holds them —
saved or not — makes one call to the chat's model and answers with what
the client applies: shape records for the strokes they replace, or the
Markdown of a text box. What is sent and how the reply is read is
gamma/ink_ai.py; nothing is stored here.

Both answer in NDJSON as /ai/translate/brief does: ``{"ping": 1}`` lines
while the model thinks (a reasoning model can be quiet past a proxy's idle
limit), then one line with the answer or ``{"error"}``."""
